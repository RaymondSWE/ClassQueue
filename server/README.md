This project implements a heterogeneous distributed queue system for supervision classes, allowing students to enter the queue and supervisors to manage the queue. The system interacts with a reference server and showcases the use of ZeroMQ for distributed messaging. The features will be that students will be able to join the waiting queue, real time updates of the queue to all clients should be shown. Supervisor should be able manage the queue a nice dashboard would be nice. Use tinyqueue API (compatitble). Also ZeroMQ should be implemented for distributed messaging.
