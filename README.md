## Introduction
Welcome to the ClassQueue! This system is for a school project and demonstrates a distributed queue with a client-server architecture using ZeroMQ for messaging. The server is built with Java and Spring Boot, and the client is developed in Python using a Tkinter-based GUI. We initially considered using Electron but switched to Python for better native support for ZeroMQ.

## Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Efficient handling of events using ZeroMQ.
- **Multi-Client Support:** Multiple clients can connect and join the queue.
- **Supervisor and Student Roles:** Different functionalities based on user roles.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism:** Maintains queue integrity by checking client activity.

## Project Overview
ClassQueue is a school project that allowed students to pick their languages or frameworks. We chose Spring Boot and Python to demonstrate an event-driven architecture, which is more efficient than constantly streaming data and can earn a High-Performance Mark (HPM).

## Reflection
During development, we maintained a structured workflow with protected main branches, requiring pull requests and code reviews. Manual tests were conducted on each branch before merging PRs. The project was both enjoyable and educational.

## Getting started
You need to have the following installed to run this project:
- Java 17 or later
- Python 3.12 or later
- A Maven environment
  
### Setting Up the server
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory at the project's root.
2. Run the following command to install all the dependencies:
```console
mvn install
```
After the dependencies have been installed successfully, use the following command to run the server:
```console
mvn spring-boot:run
```
### Setting Up the client

1. The client directory is located at the root of the project. Open a terminal and navigate to python-client.
2. Run the following command to install the required libraries:
   
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. The student and supervisor client is located under python-client/src and can be run using the following command:
   
```console
python student.py
python supervisor_client.py
```
