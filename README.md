## Introduction
Welcome to the ClassQueue! This system is for a school project and demonstrates a distributed queue with a client-server architecture using ZeroMQ for messaging. The server is built with Java and Spring Boot, and the client is developed in Python using a Tkinter-based GUI. We initially considered using Electron but switched to Python for better native support for ZeroMQ.

## Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Efficient handling of events using ZeroMQ.
- **Multi-Client Support:** Multiple clients can connect and join the queue.
- **Supervisor and Student Roles:** Different functionalities based on user roles.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism:** Maintains queue integrity by checking client activity.

## Project Overview
ClassQueue is a school project that allowed students to pick their languages or frameworks. We chose Spring Boot and Python to demonstrate an event-driven architecture, which is more efficient than constantly streaming data and can earn a High-Performance Mark (HPM).

The backend server is built with Java and Spring Boot, handling the core logic and interactions. Two main worker components, `PublisherWorker` and `ResponderWorker`, manage the communication and processing:
- **PublisherWorker:** Broadcasts updates to the clients, ensuring they receive the latest queue status and messages.
- **ResponderWorker:** Handles incoming client requests, processes them, and performs necessary actions like updating queue status and responding to heartbeats.


## Reflection
During development, we maintained a structured workflow with protected main branches, requiring pull requests and code reviews. Manual tests were conducted on each branch before merging PRs. The project was both enjoyable and educational.

## Getting started
You need to have the following installed to run this project:
- Java 17 or later
- Python 3.12 or later
- Maven
- ZeroMQ
  
### Setting Up the Server
1. Clone the repository:
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/RaymondSWE/ClassQueue.git
    cd ClassQueue/server
    ```
2. Install dependencies and build the project:
    ```console
    mvn install
    ```
3. Run the server:
    ```console
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Setting Up the Client
1. Navigate to the `python-client` directory:
    ```console
    cd ../python-client
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the client applications located in src folder:
    ```console
    python student.py
    python supervisor_client.py
    ```
